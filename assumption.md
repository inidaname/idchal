## Build The Fraud Search Challenge
#### Tools
- **Database**: MongoDB database, as a noSQL database using JSON collection this gives me developer the flexibility of using JavaScript syntax all through the application.
- **Frameworks**: 
	- **Backend**: Node.js ExpressJs, one of the most used Node.js framework and my familiriate with it I believed it is the right framework for this as any other developer can take it up or I will find easier to explain to my colleague
	- **Frontend**: Angular 7, this is the required framework as of the instruction plus it is a framework I am most comfortable with abstracting the need to write too much HTML only need to focus on logic.
	
- **Language**: 
	- Typescript a superset of JavaScript this was used both on the backend and frontend.
	- Scss a CSS transpiler, a more maintanble CSS syntax for easy to adopt among a team
- **Testing**: 
	- **Frontend**: Karma and Jasmine an Angular built in testing suite,
	- **Backend**: Postman an API testing platform.
- Others: Angular Material, Ag-Grid, Docker, and Flexbox.

#### Assumptions
I used the MC (Model, Controller) parttern by seprating each file and instances for better maintainability and scalable.
I built the application focusing on the user to have quick, easy and simple features by focusing primarily on the important aspect such as the search fields, the search button and result section by providing him with quick response.
Test written to give quick glance of the application bootstrap, Unit Test focusing on the minimal and important aspect of the app such making sure the components were instanciated.
